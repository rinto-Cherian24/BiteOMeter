### Project Description
A fun AI-powered system that checks whether you bite your nails â€” because why not? Using image processing, it detects the proportion of the off-white nail area and declares you guilty (or innocent).

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Too many people bite their nails without realising it â€” the real tragedy is, no one has a computer program to tell them about it.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built an AI + OpenCV based tool that analyses a photo of your hand, detects the pink and off-white nail regions, and warns you if your nail length is suspiciously short.
