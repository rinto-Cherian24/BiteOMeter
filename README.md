### Project Description
A fun AI-powered system that checks whether you bite your nails ‚Äî because why not? Using image processing, it detects the proportion of the off-white nail area and declares you guilty (or innocent).

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Too many people bite their nails without realising it ‚Äî the real tragedy is, no one has a computer program to tell them about it.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built an AI + OpenCV based tool that analyses a photo of your hand, detects the pink and off-white nail regions, and warns you if your nail length is suspiciously short.

### Project Demo
# Video
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UCX662AiMLtEylYk5IYnIi0_nKHQ6Gd7/view?usp=drive_link
In the video demo uploaded here, the backend part i.e., the Python virtual environment is set up(venv) and then the app.py is run which starts running the model and it becomes active. The backend part being set up, the frontend part index.html is opened externally. On opening the webpage the user has options to enter his/her name and upload his/her hand image for the nail-judgement. On submitting the user receives the final judgement of biting off their nails or keep them for further growth.
